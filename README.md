# Applying CRUD methods in a simple node.js app

This project was done while following the tutorial : https://youtu.be/W1Kttu53qTg.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## What I used
This is mainly an application that was implemented with Node.js and Express.js and used EJS for the Views. 

## Current status
Currently only the backend (tested by postman) can Create, Read, Update and Modify. The views are, so far, only able to Create and Read. Feel free to implement the Update and Modify parts that should be done in the views directory.
